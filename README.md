# Basic Hardhat Project Boilerplate

> This smart-contracts-development-boilerplate is mostly based on hardhat and includes foundry fuzz-testing feature.

## Prerequisites

- Install [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) for fuzzing the smart contracts. Go through the [installation instructions](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) to install foundry.
- Configure the foundry.toml as per your requirements. Refer to the [foundry config reference](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/config/) for more details.
- Install truffle : `npm i -g truffle`
- The latest version of truffle has issues with installation on Windows.
- To resolve the errors, go to [this page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&channel=Release&version=VS2022&source=VSLandingPage&cid=2030&passive=false), download Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 and then install the Visual Studio Installer.
- Select Desktop Development with C++ and uncheck all the optional installation options.
- Once it is done, the truffle can be installed with `npm i -g truffle`

## Instructions and commands

- Install the boilerplate project dependencies. \
  Do a check for the latest npm package versions. \
  This will update the versions inside the package.json.

  ```shell
  npx npm-check-updates -u
  ```

  ```shell
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```

  ```shell
  yarn
  ```

  This will install the packages mentioned inside the `package.json` file.

- Compile the smart contracts.

  ```shell
  yarn clean-compile
  ```

- Check for linting and formatting errors in the code. This will display all the code errors and warnings in the terminal.

  ```shell
  yarn check
  ```

- Generate the typechain types for the smart contracts. This will create a `typechain-types` folder comprising all the typechain types, in the root directory of the project.

  ```shell
  yarn typechain
  ```

- Compute the size of the smart contracts. This will display the size of the smart contracts in the terminal.

  ```shell
  yarn size
  ```

- Run the test scripts. This uses the hardhat network configured in the `hardhat.config.ts` file to run the tests.

  ```shell
  yarn test
  ```

- To run the tests on your localhost node for debugging purposes, you can run the following commands.\
  Instantiate the hardhat local node.

  ```shell
  yarn localnode
  ```

- Split the terminal running the hardhat node, or, open another terminal and run the project test scripts using the local node.

  ```shell
  yarn test:local
  ```

- Run the foundry test cases, written in solidity, which should be present inside the `test/foundry` folder.

  ```shell
  yarn test:forge
  ```

- Generate the code coverage report. \
  After generating the report, you can open the `coverage/index.html` file to see the results.

  ```shell
  yarn coverage
  ```

- Generate the documentation for the smart contracts. This will create a `docs` folder comprising all the documentation related to the smart contracts, in the root directory of the project.

  ```shell
  yarn doc
  ```

- Instantiate the truffle dashboard. \
  This lets you deploy the contracts without the need of pasting the private key anywhere in the project.

  ```shell
  truffle dashboard
  ```

- The browser will open up and then you have to connect with the MetaMask extension. Select the preferred network and the account to deploy the smart contract.

- Deploy the hardhat project smart contracts using your preferred network or the truffle dashboard, by specifying the `NETWORK`. If you are using any network other than `truffle` or `localhost`, then the private key of the account from which the smart contract is to be deployed, should be specified in the `.env` file.

  ```shell
  yarn deploy {NETWORK}
  ```

- If `truffle` has been specified as the `NETWORK`, then switch to the browser and sign the deployment transaction from the MetaMask extension.

- After the succesful deployment of the smart contracts, a `build/deploy.json` file will be generated comprising the deployed addresse and the ABI of the smart contracts.

- Verify the smart contract using the `NETWORK` on which it was deployed and the smart contract address, alongwith the constructor arguments by modifiying the `verify.ts` file, and entering the network name in the CLI after running the following command.

  ```shell
  yarn verify {NETWORK}
  ```

## A typical top-level directory layout
